# Shopping_Helper

The idea for this poject is to make an dutch shopping helper
the idea is to let AI create a week dinner menu that can acces dutch supermarkts websites to check the products,

Dutch supermarktes have this thing called bonus, its where you get a lot of 10%, 20% discounts on groceries so the idea is to give all the products of the different stores that have bonus to the AI and basis on that it generates recipes.

it would be nice if we get like 3 recipes for the week it should keep track of multiple use ingriedients. Take something like lettuce for example, if i get a head of lettuce for one recipe it will just sit in the fridge and spoil. it would be nice of the AI to keep track of these items and use it in multiple recipes so it wont spoil. 

it would also be nice if the code can acces the supermarket website to view the products that are not bonus so we can check the full price of the groceries. 
with this we could also check things like callories so we can have the AI also give us the full callorie breakdown of the recipe.

would be great if we can give the AI recipes we like so it creates things like it, also goes for recipes we dislike
